    <h2>What is Github?</h2>
    <p>
      Github is a website and service that helps developers store, access, and collaborate on their code with ease. Github has support for all languages and serves as an powerful 
      tool for organizing and maintaing your code. Before we get started, it's important that you know a few terms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Repository:</b> A repository is like a folder where you store, access, and share your projects. A repository will contain all of your project's files like your code or images, and will keep track of every change you make to your files. A repository can be made public or private, and be accessed and edited by every collaborator on the repository.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <b>Fork:</b> Suppose someone sees your repository and would like to make their own changes. They can fork, or make a clone of your repository and freely make changes from there. The original owner of the repository can choose to adopt any changes made to the fork, and the person who forked your repository can do the same.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <b>Branch:</b> Branches are parallel versions of a project which you can use to make changes to your project without affecting the "live" version or master branch and later merge these changes into the original.
        These are similar to Forks, but they are made by collaborators.
      </li>
      </ul>
