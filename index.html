    <h2>What is Github?</h2>
    <p>
      Github is a website and service that helps developers store and access their code with ease. Github has support for all languages and, if used properly, can serve as an effective 
      tool for organizing and maintaing your code. Now first off for some vocabulary:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Repository:</b> workspace where you store, access, and share your projects. We recommend you download the client and use that,(instead of pushing <b>commits</b>)
        from the browser. This way, you can work on your projects offline or at your leisure and make one giant commit all at once instead of making small commits one at a 
        time. Furthermore, you cannot undo commits through the browser, but only through the client or shell(Command prompt window which works through typing in commands. If 
        you can understand how to use this, more power to you)
      </li>  
      <li>
        <b>Fork:</b> Suppose someone sees your projecct and finds a way to improve it. This is what forks are for. Forks are parallel versions
        of a repository which can be merged with the original. Anyone can make a fork off of a public repository.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <b>Branch:</b> Branches are parallel versions of a project which you can make to test different ideas of how to work around the situation.
        These are similar to Forks, but they are made by collaborators(people who work on the project).
      </li>
